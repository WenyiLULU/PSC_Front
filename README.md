# Pet Social Club Front-end

## Description
PSC is an application that connects people looking for pet sitters to take care of their animals with users who are available to do so in a selected timeframe. 
 
For best performance use a computer with a Chrome or Firefox browser to view the site. It is also supported for mobile phone use. 

The project was to create an online app with MERN stack. We used Express.js, JavaScript, Mongo, Node.js, React as well as Mantine. The app includes sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords and the private routes are protected. Further technical improvements could be made to the website in the future.

For this project, the back-end and front-end are seperated in two repositories.

The website was first launched in July 2022 via Heroku and Netlify.
